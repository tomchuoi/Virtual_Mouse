# Virtual Mouse Control with Hand Tracking

This project demonstrates a virtual mouse control system using hand tracking with OpenCV and PyAutoGUI. The program uses a webcam to track hand movements and translates them into mouse cursor movements and clicks on the screen.

## Features

- Tracks the user's hand using the webcam.
- Moves the mouse cursor based on the user's index finger position.
- Performs left-click when the user's index and middle fingers are raised and close together.
- Supports real-time display of the webcam feed with visual feedback.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Mediapipe
- PyAutoGUI
